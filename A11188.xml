            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

mine opinion of them in briefe, that whereas ≈øome doe attribute ≈øo much to di≈øtillations and preparations of Minerals, Animales, and Vegetables, that they firmely hold both the parts of Phi≈øicke as well <hi>Hygeinen</hi> as <hi>Thera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peyticen</hi> to bee completely perfourmed onely by them, and others ≈øo much wilfully bent or ignorantly ≈øeduced again≈øt the true intended perfection of Phi≈øicke, doe contrarily hold, that it is onely de≈øperate and dangerous Phi≈øicke which is attempted by minerals, prepared by the Spagiricall arte, and that it had bene farre better, that it had ≈ølept in ≈øilence and neuer bene knowen to the world. Betwixt the≈øe two extremes I thinke it be≈øt to hold a meane, ≈øo that I neither allow the extremitie of the one, nor imbrace the defects of the other: but mine opinion is, that both the ≈øorts of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinable preparation of ≈øimples, as well that which is done by the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries craft, as al≈øo by the Spagiricall art, I ≈øay, both of them haue their proper place and nece≈ø≈øary v≈øes in Phi≈øick, <hi>(amicus Plato, amicus Ari≈øtoteles, ≈øed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis amica veritas)</hi> ≈øo that I iudge this latter age of the world much bound to the careful ≈øearchers out of tho≈øe hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> ≈øecrets of nature, which are ≈øo bound vp in minerals and vegetables, and outwardly do not appeare but by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and magi≈øterie, and great folly it were vtterly to reiect them as many wilfully doe.

               <head>CHAP. 2. Of the nature and qualitie of this Catholicon Aureum.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>HIppocrates</hi> in the ≈øecond <hi>Apho.</hi> of his fir≈øt booke, and the 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. and 9. <hi>Aphor.</hi> of the fourth booke, maketh mention of two ≈øortes of purging medicines, the one by vomit, the other by ≈øiege: Of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging medicines by vomit, <hi>Me≈øue</hi> in his fir≈øt booke, <hi>De ≈øimplicibus medicamentis Purgantibus,</hi> the fir≈øt Theorem, maketh a thr√©efold diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, taken from their facultie more or le≈ø≈øe. The fir≈øt he termeth vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which extreamely di≈øturbe nature, as white Hellebor, and Tithi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, &amp;c. The ≈øecond meane, as <hi>Nux vomica and Nitrum.</hi> The third mild, as Onion ≈ø√©ed and Radi≈øh. But of ≈øimple medicines which purge by ≈øiege, he maketh a fourefold difference. The fir≈øt, are ≈øuch as purge by di≈ø≈øolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the humours, and being di≈ø≈øolued by attraction of them from the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per parts, or eradication from the lower parts, not that the medicine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing receiued into the ≈øtomacke, doth penetrate the veines or the ≈øolid parts of the bodie to euacuate the humor, but by a certaine attractiue qualitie, doth draw his choy≈øe and familiar humor through the veines and pa≈ø≈øages of the bodie, into the ≈øtomacke and bowels, euen as we ≈øee Iet or Amber draw little ≈øtrawes, or the Load≈øtone Iron, though they touch them not: of this kind, are Scammonie, Colocinthis and Turbith. The ≈øecond kind
<pb facs="tcp:1772:6"/>
of purging ≈øimples, are ≈øuch as doe not draw, but onely purge by driuing and pre≈ø≈øing out, drying and con≈øuming the putrid excrements, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward binding the bodie as Mirabolanes, and Tamaryndes. The third ≈øort purge by mollifying the humors within the ≈øtomacke and bowels, as Ca≈ø≈øia fi≈øtula and Manna. The fourth and la≈øt, by making them ≈ølippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as the Mu≈øcilage of P≈øillium and Mallowes: the≈øe thr√©e latter kinds of purgers haue a weake facultie, and therefore ≈øcarce per≈øpicuous, euacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating onely tho≈øe humors within the ≈øtomacke and bowels, which there they m√©ete withall, not pa≈ø≈øing the lyuer or working any thing by attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The fir≈øt kind of purging medicines which worke by attraction, <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> in his booke entitled, <hi>Quos purgare oportet,</hi> doth pronounce that they are all of a hot qualitie. <hi>Omnia medicamenta purgantia facultate ≈øunt cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> which in naturall Phylo≈øophie mu≈øt n√©edes be graunted, for there are but two actiue qualities, heate &amp; cold, as <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> witne≈ø≈øeth in his fourth booke of his <hi>Meteorologickes,</hi> the fir≈øt Chapter.</p>
               <p>Now it is manife≈øt, that it is the nature of heate alone to draw, for cold cannot doe it: therefore what≈øoeuer purgeth by attraction, mu≈øt n√©edes b√©e of a hot temperature. This being well knowne and con≈øidered, let vs ≈øee how all the≈øe kind of purgers worke, and the rea≈øon why, and then come to ≈øhew the nature and operation of this <hi>Catholicon Aureum. Galen</hi> in the fift booke of the facultie of ≈øimple medicines, affirmeth, that what≈øoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer purgeth, hath a facultie to worke on his peculiar and proper humour, ≈øome on one, ≈øome on two, and ≈øome on more; and that which is proper to any one humour, neuer worketh on another, vnle≈ø≈øe the malignitie of the medicine, or the quantitie of the do≈øe do too much exc√©ede, which <hi>Galen</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo witne≈ø≈øeth in his booke, <hi>De purgantium Medicamentoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> facultate. Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> al≈øo confirmeth it in his booke, <hi>De natura humana,</hi> ≈øaying there, That if a medicine be admini≈øtred to bring forth fleame, it onely bringeth out fleame: if to purge choler, it onely purgeth choler: if to euacuate melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, it onely euacuateth that humour: to whome <hi>Me≈øue</hi> con≈øenteth in his fir≈øt booke, <hi>De ≈øimp. medi. purg.</hi> the fir≈øt Theorem, affirming more plainly, that if a medicine be giuen to purge melancholy, though choler and fleame abound much more in the bodie, yet it leaueth them, and purgeth melancholy, his own peculiar and de≈øtinate humor: whence, they haue this ≈øtrange facultie, the ≈øame Authors opinion is, that it proceedeth not from the temperature of the medicine (meaning the fir≈øt qualities) nor from one contrarie working on another, nor from like drawing his like, nor as a light medicine vpward, a heauie downward, ≈øtirring the matter to be purged: but <hi>Quia talem coelitus e≈øt ≈øortitum facultatem:</hi> That the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of euerie purging medicine, proc√©edeth from an heauenly qualitie and hidden influence.</p>
               <p>Now hauing ≈øhewed the nature and differences of purging ≈øimples, after
<pb facs="tcp:1772:7"/>
what ≈øort they worke, and by what meanes out of their Theoricke, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth after perfect inue≈øtigation both by cau≈øe and effect, to ≈øet downe the nature and operation of this <hi>Catholicon Aureum,</hi> or generall purging powder of Gold. Then, whereas I ≈øaid before in the beginning, that all purges worke either by vomit it or ≈øiege, this powder of Gold worketh both vp vomit and ≈øiege: yet let not this derogate any thing from the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of it, that it worketh by vomit: for although I mu≈øt n√©edes confe≈ø≈øe, that euerie action of any part made again≈øt the fir≈øt ordinance of nature, is impro≈øperous and vnfit, and ≈øo ≈ø√©eing nature did at fir≈øt ordaine the <hi>Gula</hi> for attraction, and the <hi>Pilorum</hi> for expul≈øion: therefore by con≈øequent, all vomits made by contrarie motion to nature, are impro≈øperous and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: although I ≈øay, this be ≈øimply true and cannot be denied, yet re≈øpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely &amp; by accident, vomits are not onely not hurtful, but verie commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and nece≈ø≈øarie as well for the curing of di≈øea≈øes, as for the regiment of health. For when there is aboundance of light Choler, thin water, and fleame ≈øwimming on the top of the ≈øtomacke, the expul≈øiue facultie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not driue them downward, by rea≈øon of their lightne≈ø≈øe, neither is nature able to dige≈øt them, ≈øo they mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øitie be euacuated by vomit, and ≈øo of two euils the le≈ø≈øe mu≈øt bee cho≈øen, this way of purging being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and commended by <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and mightily confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the <hi>Academie</hi> of <hi>Salerne,</hi> pre≈øcribing for the regiment of health to vomit once a month. To which of the foure differences of purging medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines to referre this powder, is a matter verie difficult, ≈øeeing it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer yet truely and Philo≈øophically determined by any Paracel≈øian, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mercurie or any minerall purge did worke <hi>Attrahendo humores,</hi> by drawing the humours together into the ≈øtomacke. But my a≈ø≈øertion is, that this powder of Gold doth not worke <hi>Attrahendo,</hi> or <hi>Comprimendo,</hi> and <hi>Exprimendo,</hi> but <hi>Leniendo,</hi> and <hi>Lubricando,</hi> which I prooue thus.</p>
               <p>There is no cold medicine which doeth purge by Attraction; but the outward qualitie in the ≈øuperficies of this powder, from whence the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging facultie proc√©edeth (as is plainely ≈øhewed in the end of the ≈øixt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) is cold, therefore Íùë conclude, that it cannot draw any humors into the ≈øtomacke. My propo≈øition was proued before by the naturall effectes of heate and cold, and by the authoritie of <hi>Galen</hi> before cited, in his booke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled: <hi>Quos purgere oportete</hi> and in his fift booke, <hi>De ≈øimp. medi. facul.</hi> the ≈øixt√©ene Chapter. My a≈ø≈øumption I proue thus: as is the effect, ≈øo is the cau≈øe: but the effect which Mercurie worketh is cold, and therefore Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie it ≈øelfe is cold: My propo≈øition in the Philo≈øophers maxime, the a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumption is proued by in≈øtance in the di≈øea≈øe called the Pal≈øie, and relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Sinewes, which we ≈øee dayly happen to tho≈øe that deals much with Quick≈øiluer, as our Gilders with rich Gold, being cau≈øed by the
<pb facs="tcp:1772:7"/>
≈øinne of the Quick≈øiluer. Now that the Pal≈øie is a cold di≈øea≈øe, <hi>Galen</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øeth in his fourth booke <hi>De cau≈øis pul≈øuum.</hi> My ≈øecond in≈øtance is taken from another effect of Mercurie, which is this, When any hath taken a great quantitie, as much as will poy≈øon a bodie, during all the time of the working of it, the partie ≈øhall neuer thir≈øt, which if it were hot, it would inflame the bloud and vitall ≈øpirits, and cau≈øe intolerable thir≈øt, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth after the taking of all hot poy≈øons, for the partie will thir≈øt euen to the death, which is proued by an example cited of <hi>Conciliator,</hi> in his booke <hi>De venenis,</hi> of an Apothecarie, who thir≈øting in the extreame heate of Summer, in the night time tooke a Pitchard of Quick≈øiluer in ≈øtead of ≈øome drinke or other, and dranke of it, forthwith it cooled his thir≈øt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed the bloud, and de≈øtroyed the vitall ≈øpirits, and being found dead in his bed in the morning, his body by the aduice of a Phi≈øicion was cut vp, and there was found in his ≈øtomack one pound of Quick≈øiluer, the bloud in his heart being congealed: by which the ≈øame Authour concluded, that it was of a cold qualitie.</p>
               <p>To the≈øe in≈øtances may be added, that it is in the forme of water alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without ta≈øte, not bitter, ≈øharpe, ≈øowre, ≈øalt, ≈øw√©ete, or hauing any ≈øtiplicitie or corro≈øiuene≈ø≈øe. Be≈øides the≈øe probable inductions, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of diuers of our moderne Authors may be added, who haue diligently both by ≈øpeculation and proofe inue≈øtigated the nature of it, what≈øoeuer <hi>Paracel≈øus</hi> through vaine ≈øubtilties and trifling arguments, goeth about to per≈øwade the world that it is of a hot qualitie: then ≈øince the ≈øuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall purging qualitie of this powder is cold, it manife≈øtly proueth that it doth not purge by attraction. The ≈øecond rea≈øon which proueth that this powder doth not purge by attraction, is taken from a ≈øure demon≈øtration by certaine experience, which is this. The fir≈øt time that it is admini≈øtred vnto any bodie, it will worke his effect duely as it ought to doe, euacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the humours, but if it bee admini≈øtred againe the next day, it will then verie little worke by ≈øiege or vomit, or nothing at all, by rea≈øon the fir≈øt day it did euacuate all the humours within the ≈øtomacke and bowels, which it then met withall: now all other purges attractiue being taken againe the ≈øecond day, will worke afre≈øh, becau≈øe they ≈øtill drawe mo humours out of the veines and fle≈øhie parts of the bodie, and if there bee none to draw, they di≈ø≈øolue and melt the fle≈øh it ≈øelfe, draw bloud out of the veines, &amp; ≈øpirits out of the arteries, and ≈øo by con≈øequent life it ≈øelfe: which vice would al≈øo bee incident to this powder of Gold, if it did worke any whit by attraction, which ≈øeeing it doth not, it cannot hold with the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall po≈ø≈øibilitie of this powder, to produce any ≈øuch fatall euent: and as it worketh not <hi>Attrahendo,</hi> ≈øo neither doth it worke <hi>Comprimendo,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe it leaueth the bodie after alwayes ≈øoluble, ≈øometimes a weeke, a
<pb facs="tcp:1772:8"/>
month, yea, a quarter of a yeere: by which may bee noted the excellencie and preheminence that this purge hath aboue all other purging medicines in the world: for this mu≈øt needes be graunted, which <hi>Galen</hi> him≈øelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øeth in his booke entituled, <hi>Quos purgare oportet,</hi> That al purging me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines which worke by attraction, are verie offen≈øiue to the ≈øtomacke, and noy≈øome to all parts of the bodie, diuers ≈øymptomes and great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences following them, by rea≈øon when there is ≈øuch a ≈øuddaine vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and vnnaturall pulling, and riuing the humours from bloud wherein life con≈øi≈øteth, nature can hardly endure, this ≈øeperation being before ≈øo firmely vnited together, without her great detriment and lo≈ø≈øe of many ≈øpirits, the inconueniences and vices whereof, I will ≈øhew at large in the ≈øixt Chapter.</p>
               <p>Now this purge of Gold, ≈øeeing it worketh not by attraction, cannot be ≈øcandalized with any of tho≈øe blots, neither can any ≈øuch ≈øymptomes follow it. But happily ≈øome may here obiect, that if it onely purge <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niendo</hi> and <hi>Lubricando,</hi> and not <hi>Attrahendo;</hi> how can it remoue and purge ≈øtubborne and rebellious humors, out of the veines and ≈øolid remote parts of the bodie, and then not being able to remoue them, how can it be good almo≈øt for any di≈øea≈øe: and to conclude, it were as good to take a gli≈øter, or eate a little Ca≈ø≈øia, Manna, or ≈øtued Pruines, as to take this golden purge. To this I an≈øwere, that though it purge not the humours within the veines and fle≈øhie parts by attraction: yet it doth either helpe nature to dige≈øt them, or expell them by ≈øweate and Vrine, which is a direct cour≈øe according to natures owne proc√©edings: ≈øo you ≈øee that it doth worke by vomit, ≈øiege, ≈øweate, and vrine, according as nature is burdened and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerladed: for if the ≈øtomacke bee oppre≈ø≈øed with light choler, water, and flegme, it purgeth them by vomit: if the inte≈øtines and lower parts bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercharged with choler, water, or flegme, it worketh by ≈øiege: if either ≈øtomacke or bowels be ouerladen with melancholy, it euacuateth alwaies that humour by ≈øiege: if the bloud and the ≈øolid parts of the bodie bee op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed with any of tho≈øe humours, it di≈ø≈øolueth them and openeth their pa≈ø≈øage, and purgeth them by ≈øweate and in≈øen≈øible expiration. If the Emulgent veines or reynes of the backe be burdened with choler, flegme, or melancholy, or haue any ob≈øtructions, it openeth the pa≈ø≈øages, di≈ø≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the humours, and bringeth them out by Vrine; for it purgeth all the vicious and offen≈øiue humours alike, not hauing any humour de≈øtinate to it, but as the body is mo≈øt ouercharged, on that it worketh fir≈øt. In the an≈øwering this obiection, a greater may ari≈øe among the learned, and that is this: Whereas I ≈øay that this powder of Gold dooth purge by ≈øweate and Vrine, how can that agr√©e with naturall Philo≈øophie and experience, that a cold qualitie (which I affirmed before this powder had) can open,
<pb facs="tcp:1772:8"/>
di≈ø≈øolue, ≈øweate, and expell by Vrine. To this I an≈øwere, that though the outward ≈øuperficiall qualitie of this powder of Gold bee cold, from the Mercurialitie, yet inwardly there is a ≈øubtill acrious heate, from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reitie, which is ≈øtirred vp and animated by the naturall heats of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and brought in <hi>Energian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nature being alwayes wi≈øe in her working, making ≈øeperation of the cold qualitie in the ≈øuperficies of the medicine, to worke by vomit and ≈øiege: and ≈øelecting the ≈øubtill inward medicinable vertue, drawing it into the veynes to helpe her ≈øelfe to worke away all that offendeth her, ≈øh√©e be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwayes prone to her emendation and perfection. And thus I haue ≈øhewed in generall the nature and working of this powder of Gold; but fearing le≈øt I haue exc√©eded tho≈øe ≈øtraite limits I alotted my ≈øelfe, I am enforced to omit many things that were expedient to bee ≈øpoken of this matter: onely touching the≈øe things, as briefe as I could, which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øarie; but if there be any that re≈øts not contented with that which here is ≈øaid, I will by conference fully ≈øati≈øfie him at any occa≈øion.</p>

               <p>In all the≈øe di≈øea≈øes it is good to take of this powder, yet imagine not that this of it ≈øelfe will cure them perfectly, yet many of them it will, as mo≈øt ≈øort of Headaches, &amp; weaknes of the ≈øtomacke, all ≈øorts of wormes, the thr√©e Fluxes with an other ≈øimple after the body is purged, the Stone in the reynes, womens termes, &amp; all maner of Agues (the Feuer Hecticke, and Mara≈ømus excepted) whether the humours bee enflamed within the veynes or without, in al maner of people, ≈øucking children and other, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly at once taking, but for the Quartan it will a≈øke longer time.

               <p>Finally, for the French Pox<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> or any ≈øimptome therof beginning, it is the mo≈øt ≈øingular medicine that euer was found out, for without hot-hou≈øes, loth≈øome diet drinkes, bathing in Cornelius Tub, any other Purgations, annoyntments, fumes, or Suffumigations with Quick≈øiluer, making mo≈øt loth≈øome Excoriations and painefull Exulcerations, eating the teeth out of the head, and di≈ø≈øoluing the Sinewes, and other ≈øimptomes, this onely of it ≈øelfe, if it be taken before the de≈øperate ≈øymptomes doe appeare, will cure them, and doubtle≈ø≈øe excelleth all other that art or nature can this day afford.</p>
               <p>In like maner it may be probably coniectured, by the authoritie of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Authors, and rea≈øoning from the materials whereof it is made, that it may cure the Gout, if it be not alreadie grown to a de≈øperate period. Now that I haue ≈øhewed for what di≈øea≈øes this powder is good, ≈øome may expect that I ≈øhould ≈øet downe the particular experiences that I haue made of it, to wit, the Cures which it hath performed, with the names of the parties, the time when, &amp; the place of their abode, to the intent it might the better per≈øwade the hard beleeuing world, of the good effects of it, &amp; giue greater credit to my words.

The fir≈øt is, Agues, becau≈øe they doe inflame the humours. The ≈øecond, Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lalgia, by rea≈øon of their vapours fuming vp into the head. The third, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigo, cau≈øed by the circumaction of vapours ray≈øed vp into the braine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his ventricles and arteries. The 4. imbecility of ≈øight, by rea≈øon of too much drine≈ø≈øe of the parts of the eyes, which follow ≈øuperfluous euacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or of the humour within the nerue optick, which tho≈øe purges di≈ø≈øolue and cannot euacuate. The 5. weakene≈ø≈øe of the ≈øtomacke, cau≈øed diuers wayes by the di≈øtemperature which the medicine bred. The 6. immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate thir≈øt, cau≈øed by the ≈øaltne≈ø≈øe, ≈øharpne≈ø≈øe, heate and bitterne≈ø≈øe of the medicine. The 7. ≈øighing, cau≈øed either of immoderate heat and acrimony of the medicine gnawing the ≈øtomacke, or by his drine≈ø≈øe drawing it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The 8. payne of the ≈øtomacke, cau≈øed of the vnequall di≈øtempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or exulceration which the purge made. The 9. excoriation of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels, through the corro≈øiue and fretting qualitie of the medicine. The 10. inflamation of the reynes, proc√©eding from the heate of the medicine. 11. The ≈øtone of the reynes, by rea≈øon of abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce of ≈ølimy matter brought to that place, and by heat baked into a ≈øtone. 12. Voyding of bloud, prouoked by the vlceration of the bowels. 13. Tena≈ømus, or a vayne de≈øire to goe to ≈øtoole, by rea≈øon the ≈øpincter or mu≈øcle of the fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t is vlcerated through the acrimony of the medicine or humour voyded. 14. The Emmorrhoids or Plies cau≈øed by ≈øuch medicines as open the veynes. 15. Imbecility or
<pb facs="tcp:1772:11"/>
weakene≈ø≈øe of the whole bodie, by rea≈øon of the generall di≈øturbance of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, cau≈øed by the violence of the medicine. 16. Convul≈øion, cau≈øed of much matter ≈øtirred vp and drawne together, but not euacuated, which after hauing recour≈øe to the ≈øinewes and mu≈øcles, cau≈øeth convul≈øion. 17. Co≈øtiuene≈ø≈øe, the body being left hot and drie after the purge, and then ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the excrements, which doth happen in ≈øundrie purgations, &amp; mo≈øt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients complaine of it. All which di≈øea≈øes do happen to them that take pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations for three e≈øpeciall cau≈øes, being thr√©e maine vices incident to mo≈øt of v≈øuall medicines that purge. The fir≈øt, when they doe moue, di≈ø≈øolue, and draw together offen≈øiue humors, and nature not able to euacuate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>. The ≈øecond, when humours are euacuate illegitmately and with mole≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Patient, which happeneth whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> they are mini≈øtred for tho≈øe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours which they ought not. The third, when they doe too much euacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, working too violently, making excoriation of the ≈øtomack and bowels, and drawing the bloud out of the veynes. For the correction of the≈øe ≈øymptoms, the learned Phi≈øicions in all ages, hauing e≈øpeciall care of their Patients health, laboured by all means po≈ø≈øible to find out Antidotes and correctors to with≈øtand their inconueniences, and breake their malice: and in regard each purging medicine had ≈øome manife≈øt vice or other, they did not onely inuent generall correctors to auoyd ≈øuch capitall vices, but al≈øo particular for euery ≈øuch medicine. Hence Aloes had Ma≈øtick, Bdellium, and Tragagant, to keepe it from opening of the veynes &amp; drawing bloud out of them, and cau≈øing the Emmorrhoids. Mirabolanes were prepared with oyle of ≈øweete Almonds, and admini≈øtred with iuice of Fumitary, Wormwood, Agarick, and Spikenard, and Diureticks, to hinder them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> cau≈øing ob≈øtructions. Scammony was corrected with iuice of Quinces and vineger, to breake his malice, and giuen with Aromaticks and comforters of the principall parts, to ouercome his enmitie to the whole bodie. Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bith was corrected with Ginger, to auoyd windine≈ø≈øe: and ≈øo in like maner euery one had his particular correcter, directer, and helper to worke duly, &amp; qualifie their vices. This knowne and well con≈øidered, it re≈øteth to ≈øhew whether there be any ≈øuch vice in this <hi>Catholicon Aureum</hi> or no; &amp; herein is the difference ≈ø√©ene betw√©ene this and all other purges, that whereas all of them n√©ed correctors to breake their malice, Aromatickes to take away their loth≈øomne≈ø≈øe and help their working, admixture of contraries to ≈øtay their violent and immoderate operation, and Cordials to comfort &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the principall parts: So that if the ill effects they worke, be weighed in an equall ballance with their good, the good will ≈øcarce counterpoy≈øe it. This powder onely hath this grace, that it neuer offendeth any of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall parts, neuer draweth bloud out of the veynes, neuer worketh too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently, euacuating more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> is burden≈øome to nature, neuer inflameth the
<pb facs="tcp:1772:12"/>
bloud, or any part of the body, neuer maketh exulceration of the ≈øtomack &amp; bowels, neuer violently draweth humours, but after a direct cour≈øe hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth nature to dige≈øt them or expell them by ≈øweat, vrine, and expiration, neuer n√©edeth any corrector, nor hath any ≈øuch inconuenience: therefore by con≈øequent, neuer rai≈øeth any ≈øuch ≈øymptoms which v≈øually follow the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the other purges, but contrarywi≈øe I affirme that it ≈øtrengtheneth the heart, the liuer, the braine, and the whole body, purifieth the bloud, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiueth the ≈øpirits, making them fit and apt to doe all their functions natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. That this is true, I giue the learned thus much to con≈øider. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials whereof this powder con≈øi≈øteth in generall are two, for in it are two corporeall ≈øub≈øtances mixed and vnited together, not as <hi>Elementa in compo≈øito mixta in≈øeperabilia,</hi> but as ≈øalt di≈ø≈øolued and mixed with water, or ≈øugar in wine <hi>per minima</hi> as farre as that mixion and vnicion may be, yet with more fixation and very hard (yet po≈ø≈øible) ≈øeperation. One of the ≈øub≈øtances is Metalline fixed, the other Mercuriall fixed agent &amp; pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Of the≈øe two vnited together is this powder made; from the≈øe two in one, proc√©ed two ≈øeuerall qualities, the one purging by ≈øiege <hi>Leniendo</hi> and <hi>Lubricando;</hi> by vomit <hi>Os ≈øtomachi aperiendo,</hi> and <hi>Naturam fortiter mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uendo.</hi> The other comforting from the Aureity, and helping naturall heat to di≈ø≈øolue open, and expell what≈øoeuer is offen≈øiue either within the ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels, or without, by ≈øweat and expiration: and as neither Mercury it ≈øelfe without his incorruptible patient can ≈øafely purge or work any good effect, ≈øo neither Gold without his Mercuriall agent the true minerall fire, can be ≈øo ≈øubtiliate as to comfort nature &amp; expell offen≈øiue humours, but both Philo≈øophically circulate together make this perfect purge. From the≈øe rea≈øons it may be gathered, why it both purgeth and comforteth, from the one qualitie leauing the body long after ≈øoluble, from the other qualitie ≈øtrengthening the vitall ≈øpirits and animall faculties, re≈øtoring al≈øo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heat and radicall moy≈øture to the temperature thereof.</p>

               <p>CVrteous Reader, I haue thus br√©efely and truely ≈øhewed the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials whereof this powder con≈øi≈øteth, the preparation of it, the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and operation, the differences betw√©ene this and all other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and in what di≈øea≈øes it is good to take it; yet imagine not that it will cure them of it ≈øelfe alone, but onely ≈øeruing for a preparation to their cures, where≈øoeuer there n√©edeth any purging in ≈øtead of all other,
